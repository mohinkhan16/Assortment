📘 C Programming – Array & Matrix Projects

This repository features a collection of C programs focused on 1D and 2D array operations, designed to help beginners and enthusiasts strengthen their understanding of arrays, loops, and matrix manipulation. Each program addresses a specific problem, including identifying negative numbers in an array, finding the largest element, computing the transpose of a matrix, and calculating the sum of rows and columns. These exercises showcase practical implementations of fundamental programming concepts while improving logical thinking and problem-solving skills.

📂 Projects Overview

1. Extract Negative Numbers from an Array
This program reads a set of integers from the user and prints only the negative values. It demonstrates the use of dynamic arrays (variable-length arrays), loop-based input, and conditional checks for filtering data.

2. Find the Maximum Element in an Array
This program accepts an array of numbers and identifies the largest element. It uses iterative comparison and tracking techniques, making it suitable for understanding how loops and conditional statements work together to process data efficiently.

3. Transpose of a Matrix
This program reads a matrix from the user and outputs its transpose. It emphasizes nested loop usage, column-wise element traversal, and fundamental matrix operations—skills essential for handling multidimensional arrays.

4. Row & Column Sum in a Matrix
This program calculates the sum of each row and column of a user-defined matrix. It uses independent sum variables for rows and columns, demonstrates clear row-wise and column-wise traversal, and outputs results in a clean, formatted manner.

🧪 Sample Output

Negative Numbers:
Input: 10 -4 7 -9 3 → Output: -4 -9

Maximum Element:
Largest element in array → 89

Transpose:
Original:

1 2 3  
4 5 6

Transpose:

1 4  
2 5  
3 6

Row & Column Sum:
Row sums → Row 1 = 15, Row 2 = 20
Column sums → Col 1 = 7, Col 2 = 9, Col 3 = 19
